The goal of bioscreen is to make the analysis of bioscreen data quick and easy ;)

Two files are necessary to run the app:
1. csv generated from the bioscreen program
2. xlsx file containing map of bioscreen plate

Example files are in data-raw diretory.

## Installation

You can install the released version of smoother from Github:

bioscreen::run_app()
```
